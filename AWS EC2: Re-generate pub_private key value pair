# If you accidentally deleted your server's ".ssh/authorized_keys" then follow below steps

# lost key instance => lost_ec2
# new launched instance => new_ec2

step 2: stop lost_ec2 instance and dettache volume.
step 3: attach lost_ec2 volume to new_ec2 volume.

step 4: log in to new_ec2 using new_pem.pem file.

  mkdir /mnt/recovery
  #Mounting the volume using the previously annotated parameter as first argument
  mount /dev/sdf(enter new name asxvdf if any error) /mnt/recovery
  cat /home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys > /mnt/recovery/home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys
  #Un-mounting the volume
  umount /mnt/recovery/
  
  step 6: Wait for some time as it will take time.
  
  
  step 7: Now re attach it to lost_ec2 as device path /dev/sda1
  
  
  st2p 8: Now you will be able to login to this lost_ec2 instance using new_pem.pem file
